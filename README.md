# Employee List Project

This documents my attempt to learn how to develop a full-stack CRUD web application for managing a list of employees, built using Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, and jQuery. The project provides features such as employee listing, addition, updating, and deletion, along with searching and pagination. I did the project by following a Youtube Video Tutorial (cf Resources SEction)
